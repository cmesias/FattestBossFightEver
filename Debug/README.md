# Introduction
 
This is a bullet hell game inspired by a YouTuber named ButWhyLevinâ€™s "Bullet hell he made in 48 hours", and also inspired by Gungeon!

This is a quick 1 level game I made for fun  :P, and feedback is always welcome and appreciated! I want to know how I can improve myself and my games :)

# Controls

- WASD: Move
- C: Parry attacks
- Spacebar: Dash (Invulnerable state)
- Left Mouse Button : Slash Attack & Shoots out a Slash projectile

**A successful parry will**: 
- Hold your parry longer
- Grant health
- Grant mana
- Reduce parry cool down

**Destroy Boss bullets:** 
- Grant mana

#Note
Also levels 2 - 5 were created on a whim. I will be working on a more official levels for those levels.

This game is FREE! But if you would like to support me and what I do, please support me by purchasing me games :).
