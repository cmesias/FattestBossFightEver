// Notes

/*
 * ShowSplashScreen() -> ShowMenu()
 * 						 -> mainMenu.Show(gWindow, gRenderer, result);
 *						 -> mainMenu.Render() - its crashing here, why?
 *						 -> [x] - Fixed: it was rendering some stuff from Joystick variables that were
 *						 	      not initialized so we just commented it out.
 *
 * Other Notes:
 * - the screen is being render at 1920x1080, but we shrinking it to 1280x720

 *
 * TODO [ ] - Fix this checkBossDied() at PlayGame.cpp
 * 			  not really considered a bug, but if we have 5 bosses spawned,
 * 			  if the player defeats 1 boss, it will automatically save to the levelsUnlocked.mp file
 * 			  A way around this is creating a variables in PlayGame.cpp like RequiredBossesToDefeat and set it to 5.
 * 			  if the player defeats one boss at a time, the RequiredBossesToDefeat variable will reduce by 1.
 * 			  if the RequiredBossesToDefeat var reaches 0 or lower, then we save to the levelsCompleted.mp file.
